Bases Loaded in the Top of the Second Inning in Last Night's One Run Loss to the
Phillies"

Baseball pitchers taking at-bats in Major League Baseball's National League is
off the top of my head the single example in popular professional sports
whereby you are witnessing a participant be legitimately terrible at the sport they
are paid to play. Philosophical spirit-of-the-game arguments aside, some may
argue that there are a handful of pitchers who are at least passable hitters.
However, for pitchers with at least 200 plate appearances since 2009, Carlos
Zambrano is the best with a wRC+ of 65, 35% worse than your average Major League
hitter. Of the 101 pitchers who qualify under that criteria only 36 have wRC+s
greater than or equal to zero. Somehow managing to be a mathematically confounding greater
than 100% worse than your average hitter are the remaining 65. Pitchers are
very bad hitters, it cannot be overstated.

This brings us to the game played on May 17, 2019 between the Colorado Rockies
and the Philadelphia Phillies. In the top of the second inning the Phillies
managed to fielders-choice-and-error their way to allowing the bases loaded
with one out. A team in this situation on average
would expect to score about 1.5 runs before the inning is over. Unfortunately
for the Rockies this wasn't an average situation because the hitter stepping to
the plate was Jon Gray who, since he is a pitcher, is terrible at hitting by
definition. 

Jon has a career batting average of 0.091. Put another way, 
he makes an out 91% of the time he tries his best to get a hit.
The situation was not as good in reality as it might seem on paper for the Rockies. 

Making matters worse, with the bases loaded there are multiple opportunities in
which an inning-ending double play can be manufactured if Jon happened to put
the ball in play. Home-to-first, second-to-first, third-to-second,
third-to-first, that's four right there and there has to be at least like
several more but I don't want to think about all of them but most of them
happen because of a ground ball.

When bad-at-hitting-through-no-fault-of-his-own Jon Gray does manage to put the
ball in play he hits it on the ground two out of every three times. 

To round out the situation, it was Charlie Blackmon's turn to hit next after
Jon Gray. Even taking into account the universally difficult matchup for
left-handed hitting hitters versus left-handed pitching pitchers such as the current at
the time pitcher Cole Irvin, Charlie has a career batting average of 0.299. His
chances of not making an out are about three times better than Jon's. This is not
even bearing in mind his ability to get hits for more than one base which tend to
allow more runs to score than just single base hits, especially when there are
runners at every base.

Summarizing the facts: the Rockies had their hitter most likely to make an out
hitting in the situation they were most likely to score runs should a hit be
produced. Furthermore, a ball hit on the ground will most likely end the inning
and any chance of scoring runs, not to mention one of the team's best hitters
was next to hit. 

This brings us to the question at hand: why was Jon Gray even allowed to swing
the bat?

Rockies manager Buddy Black should have politely instructed Jon to under no
circumstances make any move whatsoever with his bat. But also don't make it
obvious that he has no intention of moving the bat, do not be too casual with
his general demeanor up there. The Phillies must remain convinced that the
Rockies would be so stupid to allow pitcher Jon Gray to freely swing at any pitch he
deemed hittable. Opposing pitcher Cole Irvin should not feel total license to
throw fastballs down the middle without fear of reprisal from even such
a terrible hitter. For some reason Major League pitchers tend to treat other
pitchers with the same competitive respect as non-pitchers when they are
hitting, maybe due to the fact they they themselves wish they were respected
hitters when they hit. Either way, it's better for Jon to act totally normal 
and play the whole thing super cool, but not too super cool.

The worst case scenario of not swinging is Jon strikes out on three called strikes
and registers only a single out allowing good-at-hitting Charlie
Blackmon to try his hand with the bases loaded. This hypothetical situation—two outs and
three men on base—will produce about 0.75 runs on average prior to the end of the
inning. Not as many as with one out, but still more than with three outs. 

The best case scenario of not swinging is a wild pitch, walk, or non-injury-resulting
hit-by-pitch, which would push a run across. This was not totally out of
question since the basically makes-it-up-as-he-goes Angel Hernandez was calling
balls and strikes, so you might get something to wobble your way from sheer
incompetence umpire-wise. Plus since Jon has (hypothetically) been instructed
to play it cool up there pitcher Cole Irvin will not (hypothetically, maybe) be
throwing it right down the middle for strikes. He'll still be trying to make an
out while not offering potentially hit-producing pitches i.e. obvious strikes. 

In the end, Jon Gray was allowed to swing the bat, hitting into an inning-ending 
double play, leaving Charlie Blackmon to lead off the following inning
with a (goddammit!) double. Eventually the Rockies would lose the entire game by a single run giving
hindsight's biased punch extra hutzpah.
