title: "Colorado Rockies Catcher Tony Wolters Hits Baseballs, Talks"

***Discussed:*** *hitting baseballs, enchiladas, bad wordplay, general mediocrity, wRC+, being human*

<hr />

Colorado Rockies catcher Tony Wolters is a bad hitter. However, though still not good by any stretch, this year he is
a little less bad. An improvement of this type gets one curious what's behind such a notch-above-humdrum change. I had the chance to explore this curiosity and share my findings with Tony himself when we sat down together at a Mexican restaurant. Below is the transcript of our discussion, unedited.

Me: Hi Tony. Thanks for joining me here. I see you've already
ordered. Enchiladas Ole. Good choice. I'm a Chile Relleno man myself. Crispy.

Tony: You're 20 minutes late. I couldn't wait any longer.

Me: Let's get down to business shall we? The business of talking hitting.

Tony: Let's do it.

Me: Ok, diving right in. Last year in 216 plate appearances you had a wRC+ of 45, which, let's be honest, is
shoot-yourself terrible. I mean, everyone knows you're a disturbingly bad hitter, and
if not for (Pat) Valaika you'd be easily the worst on the team.

Tony: Don't forget Noel (Cuevas). And what's wRC+?

Me: I'm glad you asked. It's a stat that does its best to measure the actual value of a hitter's
output, placing a weight on each offensive event (singles, doubles, etc) in accordance to it's relative impact on run
scoring while also taking park effects into account, putting everyone on
a theoretical even playing field, if you'll pardon the wordplay. 

Tony: Pardoned. 

Me: For wRC+ 100 is league average. In 2018 you were at 45, 55 percent worse than
your average Major League Joe.

Tony: Hitting is hard. 

Me: Especially, it seems, for you. But what is really very interesting, in the
most esoteric and not interesting sense of the word, is that this year you have
improved slightly, at least so far. 

Tony: Yes, this is true. 

Me: Do you have any guesses as to how much you've improved with regards to
wRC+, the obscure statistic the brief meaning of which you've just learned in
between bites of enchilada?

Tony: No clue.

Me: Let me tell you: thus far in 2019 your wRC+ is 73! You are now just 27
percentage points below average, an improvement of more that 50 percent of your
previous relative percentage!

Tony: I've been working hard. I transitioned from being a middle
infielder to playing catcher when I was 21 years old, you know? Catcher is considered the
most difficult defensive position to play in baseball. 

Me: Yes, it's pretty impressive what you've done in that respect over the last
5 or whatever years. Though I myself am suspect of the true value of defensive play, you are thought to be
by many a quality defensive asset. German (Marquez), who as you know is the
star pitcher of your team, is said to prefer you to all others (Chris Iannetta) as his catcher of
choice.

Tony: Thank you. I won't get into my relationship with German, but what I was
getting at is that I was an ok hitter in A-ball before I changed positions and
that devoting so much time and energy to learning how to play such a super
demanding position took away from hitting. I'm human after all. I can only do
so much at once.

Me: Yes, yes. An unenviable position to be in, if you'll pardon the wordplay.

Tony: Pardoned.

Me: The challenge for me, as a medium-quality armchair baseball analyst and fan
of the Rockies, is to understand is this mediocre improvement real? Is there
meat on the proverbial bone? Are you going to regress to your old ways
representing an actual zero in our lineup?

Tony: You do remember my game-winning hit in the Wild Card game last year?

Me: That doesn't make you good Tony.

Tony: But do you remember it?

Me: I do, and it was glorious, but let's not get distracted here. We want to
know have you actually, like for real, improved. 

Tony: I would like to think so.

Me: And I would have to agree. Do you want to know why?

Tony: Tell me.

Me: Well at first glance all of your other peripheral stats are on par with
what you usually do - walk rates, K rates, power numbers, what-have-you. But
looking at your batted ball numbers we find something that stands out.

Tony: What's that?

Me: Batted ball stats tell us-

Tony: No, I mean what stands out?

Me: Oh. What stands out is your Hard%.

Tony: Hard%?

Me: Hard% tells us how often you hit the ball hard when you hit it. Hitting the
ball hard is ideal, the thought being that the harder you hit baseballs the
less likely you are to make outs.

Tony: Like how often I hit line drives?

Me: Not exactly. It tells us what percentage of your line drives are classified
as being hit "hard", as far as line drives go. Same thing for fly balls
and ground balls. It's relative to the type of contact you make. A hard fly
ball might be a medium line drive, but you still get credit for a hard hit ball
in that scenario.

Tony: Ok, so exit velocity?

Me: No. Exit velocity is a cumulative look at the MPH of the ball when it
leaves your bat regardless of what TYPE of contact you've made.

Tony: This all seems pretty in-the-weeds.

Me: Do you want me to prove that you are now a little bit less bad than last year
or not?

Tony: Ok, so how often am I hitting the ball hard relative to the type of
contact I make? It seems like a lot if you ask me.

Me: Relative to you relative to the contact you are doing it a lot - 33.3% of your balls to be exact.
Compare that to 2018 when you hit the ball hard an abysmal 21.2% of the time. 

Tony: Wow! Not bad! Not bad at all!

Me: Don't get too excited, "not bad" is about the best we can say with reference to a 33%
hard-hit-ball rate. You are literally in the "Average" designation
for this statistic. Last year you were considered "Awful". Trevor (Story), (Ryan) McMahon, Nolan (Arenado), and
(David) Dahl are all above 40% - considered "Excellent", the paramount of the
Hard% classifications.

Tony: So why am I suddenly hitting the ball harder than ever before?

Me: Probably because you're hitting more line drives. 

Tony: Why didn't you just say that to begin with?

Me: Why does anyone do or not do anything?

Tony: Search me. But does this all mean anything?

Me: Nothing means anything, Tony. But in the slice of context we've chosen to carve out here, both here here and the cosmic here, because we're all just figuring 
out how to get ourselves out of bed everyday, I'd like to think it means that we each have the capacity to make ourselves better, and that 
it's only relative to what we were before, because if we look at it from a larger scale, with respect to others and how we compare, then we tend to feel like we're terrible, which is no way to go. I like your hair and mustache by the way.

Tony: Thank you. 

Me: How's your food?

Tony: It's a mediocre attempt, at best.

Me: We're all a work in progress I suppose. Speaking of food, where is our waitress?
