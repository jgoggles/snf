Calling this a BM seems silly.

Got to do this everyday.

The worst part is the inevitable feeling of "what is the point of writing anything down, why do I feel I'm so important that my thoughts need to be shared?".

There are a billion people smarter than me.

Is this about being smart? All the introspection makes me uncomfortable. What do I have to say?

I like the idea of playing with form in conjunction with content, but that's a meta-idea. Where are the actual ideas to put into practice using the template of the meta?

Maybe need to make the body copy font bigger.

Just need to implement a process and things will come together. That's why everyday is key.

Welcome to the dark side of the club.

Godel, Escher, Bach:

Are minds deterministic. Doug seems to be arguing yes. But what if he's argung no? He might be. If high-level symbolism give rise from low-level mechanism are the actions and interactions of those symbols deterministic?

Just keep writing this terrible drivel.

Who cares.

I get pushed and pushed but when I try to comply I can't.

I wonder where Tom Tango went.

He contributed some things.

So why do I want to write things down and share them? Why am I always drawn to do that? Part of me thinks it's about validation. I was here. I AM here. These words are artifacts of my existence, and in some way give it a bit of meaning that
can be grasped onto. Somehow the fact that I am conscious becomes less ephemeral if my thoughts are mapped onto bits!

Also confusing is the sharing part. This goes with the notion of validation I suppose. But ultimately I'm a private person. I don't share the goings on of my personal life or my thoughts and feelings to many people. 
That could be causing a feeling of supression which manifests into an urge to put things into words and communicate in a way that makes more sense to me. There is a layer of insulation in this medium. 

Ironically though, I can't really communicate the WHY of this endeavor. There is a drive to communicate and articulate my thoughts, feelings, and ideas, but there is no solid articulation of motivation. What comes from an operation that exists 
just to exist? If we're to believe the pervading romantic ideals of our culture: nothing. We're told that if you have "why" you're all set, otherwise you're heading towards failure. 
It's hard to argue against that, as I've seen it in action in my own life many times. But it's also hard to square up as mutually exclusive with worthwhileness. Meaning and contribution, both 
internally and socially, can be born from a process that has no actual goal.

From that a meta-goal comes about. I have no real reason to do this, but it can't be a terrible mess of disorder and nonsense. The meta-goal is this then: a process that is worthwhile. 

I'll accept that for now.
