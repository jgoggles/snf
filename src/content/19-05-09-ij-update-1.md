***Discussed:*** *The novel Infinite Jest pages 1-240, Grand Canyon, cool cats*

***Not Discussed:*** *Anything relating to the actual plot of Infinite Jest*

<hr />

I've just read beyond the 20% mark of [Infinite Jest](https://www.amazon.com/Infinite-Jest-David-Foster-Wallace-ebook/dp/B000S1M9LY/ref=sr_1_1?crid=4KTWR8CE3GRO&keywords=infinite+jest&qid=1557421726&s=gateway&sprefix=infinite+je%2Caps%2C166&sr=8-1). It's a hard book to characterize
justly. I mean, it's massive. Literally and literarily. The genius label is
thrown around too liberally. Beyonc√© isn't a genius. Donald Trump, not a genius.
But David Foster Wallace was an actual one, in every capacity of mind. Getting a look into someone's head who is on another
level intellectually is both challenging and stimulating. The breadth of what he
puts on display is imposing and mind blowing. His 
understanding of language, his talent for construction, the mastery of portraying humans and the high
wherewithal of observation. The obscure yet somehow not-pretentious references
littered throughout. The sweeping varieties of style. It's unbelievable.

This is my third go at Infinite Jest. Attempt One was fifteenish years ago when I was 24. I had no clue. I was curious about what I deemed the spectacle of the thing. I just wanted Dave Eggers but wearing a new outfit. Attempt Two was about ten years ago. Again, clueless. I think I came across the [Infinite Summer](http://infinitesummer.org/) project and
thought I should try again. For no other reason than to say I did. I think the
furthest I ever got was about 100 pages in. Now, on Attempt Three, though slightly less 
clueless and also remarkably more so, I've made it to page 240 and there is no doubt in my mind I'll finish the remaining 800-odd. 

The book's length can be intimidating, for sure, but being put off by a page
count itself feels a bit juvenile. The real specter of IJ is how expansive it
is, like deep water. Characters, styles, references, footnotes, digressions. The entire process of reading
the book often times feels like a trust exercise. You'll be a third of the way
through a probably several-hundred word sentence holding onto the conviction that 
Wallace and your own comprehension skills will loop you back around and things will
come together. You just need to stop swimming and the current will take you to the next island.

I can see why people humble-brag about reading Infinite Jest. I suppose that's what
I'm doing. But it's not so much a brag, really, rather than
my-God-I-need-to-share-what's-happening-here! Like what if there weren't
photos of the Grand Canyon and everyone and their mother hadn't been there?
Can you imagine seeing that fucker?[^1] You'd want
to tell people about what an amazing thing there is in the desert. Yeah, it's
a canyon, like a million other canyons, but this canyon is not like a million
other canyons because holy shit when you see it! You've got to see this canyon!

The only downside to reading this book is at the same time I've decided
I should start writing more (again), and then you just start wanting to write
like the last section of IJ you read, however tongue in cheek.[^2] First of all, who do you think you
are Mr.? You can't just go and copy DFW no more than you could dig your own
Grand Canyon. Second of all, writing is so much about genuine voice and when you're 
reintroducing yourself to the practice finding that voice can be confusing, like 
artistic puberty. So reading IJ is only going to fan those flames and potentially 
set you astray. Third, you can't help but face up to the reality that you will never, ever, be that good and this can sap your will. However, at the same time, when you're a kid you want to shoot jumpers 
like MJ, or shave like your dad, or sing like David Byrne, or dress like name some 
fucking cool cat. You emulate who you want to be like and that forms the basis of the 
mold which you will eventually break while still maintaining some rhyme with what was there before. In that sense, I'll gladly take the upside. 

[^1]: I've never seen that fucker, but I'm treading what I believe to be safe ground here based on the certified fresh reputation of the Grand Canyon, lending further credibility to the argument at hand.
[^2]: E.g. use of footnotes.
